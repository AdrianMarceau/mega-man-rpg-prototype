    <p class="text">The <strong>Mega Man RPG Prototype</strong> was created and is continually developed and maintained by Adrian Marceau / Ageman20XX, though the project would not have been possible without a great deal of inspiration and contributions from multiple outside sources.  Being a Mega Man fan-game, this project obviously owes most of it's thanks to <a href="http://www.capcom.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Capcom</a> and of course, Keiji Inafune.  Most of the assets used throughout this website and game were created by Capcom for use in the original games, so their role in this project is far from minor and greatly influential. In addition, their generally positive attitude about fan-games and other types of fan-tribute have been very admirable over the years, and both this game and the Mega Man community owe them much gratitude.</p>

    <?= mmrpg_website_text_float_robot_markup('shadow-man', 'left', '05') ?>
    <p class="text">Capcom are not the only ones to thank, however, as many others have contributed to this project over the years.  Though most of the actual design and development has been done by Adrian thus far, hours of play-testing, tons of feature ideas, mechanics discussions, and even additional sprite editing has been provided by talented and generous outside sources over the years.  New members are being added to the team all the time, and even the smallest amount of effort is appreciated.  If you would like to help with sprite editing, bug testing, feature ideas, or anything please <a href="contact/">contact me</a> and we'll discuss the details.  You'll be credited appropriately on this page, with a link back to your home page and a custom description if you want them.</p>

                Video game remixer TheLegendOfRenegade is responsible for all music and sound effects found in the Mega Man RPG and graciously agreed to let us use his work way back in July 2013.
                All tracks come from his massive, multi-game-spanning Sega Genesis / MD Remix library of music and they each bring unique and much-appreciated flavour to the atmosphere of the RPG's soundtrack.
            </p>
            <p>
                Renegade's robot master themes from Mega Man 1 - 10, Mega Man & Bass, and even Mega Man Powered Up are represented here as well as a few miscellaneous boss themes, menu themes, stage select themes, and even special stage themes from a range of classic titles.
                The overall level of quality and polish these remixes bring to our game is beyond words, and I am so, <em>so</em> grateful that we've been able to showcase them in the RPG for all these years.
            </p>
            <p>TheLegendOfRenegade has done some truly great work, and I think I speak for everyone on the team when I say &quot;thank you&quot;!  ^_^</p>

        The majority of the sprites that appear in this game were found on the number one Mega Man sprite resource - Sprites Inc. - and without the the website I'm sure many Mega Man fan-games would not have been possible.  Even the custom sprites are based on those found on this website, and I cannot thank the creators and contributors enough for their efforts and the fantastic service they provide.  I highly recommend the website for all your Mega Man sprite needs.  :)

        Miscellaneous other sprites that appear in this game have bits and pieces of sheets found on The Spriters Resource.  While Sprites Inc. is the #1 shop for Mega Man series sprites, The Spriters Resource has virtually everything other game series covered.  Another highly recommended site if what you're looking for can't be found at the above.  Thank you to all the contributors of that site who inadvertently helped with the development of this game. :)

        The Mega Man Knowledge Base is used as a constant reference for robot weaknesses, official names, artwork, quotes, and so much more.
